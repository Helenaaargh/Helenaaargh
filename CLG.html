<h1>Understanding HTML and CSS</h1>
<div class="HTML">
<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language and is 
    used to create webpages.
    <br><br>
    Imagine a web page as if it were a human body, 
    and HTML is the skeleton inside it. Just like 
    our bones give our bodies structure and shape, 
    HTML gives a web page its structure and layout.
    <br><br>
    In this "web page body," the HTML skeleton 
    consists of different parts, just like our 
    skeleton has different bones. Each bone has 
    a specific place and function. Similarly, 
    in HTML, there are different elements, 
    like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, 
    each with its own job in making the web page
    <br><br>
    The skeleton or HTML is the bare bones of the 
    webpage, and as such, it comes with a default 
    font size, style and colour like the one you 
    are seeing right now.
    </p>
    <h2>What does this structure look like?</h2>
    <img src="skeletonboy.jpg"
    style="float: left;"
    width="200"
    height="300"/>
<ul>
  <li>HEAD: Contains the title, links, styles and scripts</li>
  <p> Just like a skeleton needs a brain to control it, 
    a webpage needs the "head" of HTML to provide important 
    information, connect to other things, determine its appearance, 
    and give it the ability to do special actions.</p>
  <li>BODY: Contains the content, structure, links, buttons and lists</li>
  <p> The "body" of HTML is like the visible part of your webpage, 
    where you put all the text, images, and elements 
    that people can see and interact with, just like the skin, 
    organs, and structure of a skeleton make up the visible part 
    of a person.</p>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>What's in the code</h3>
<p>Every element requires an opening tag that looks like this
  &lthead&gt<br>
  and usually a closing tag that looks like this &lt/head&gt
  <br><br>
  But first, the head needs to tell the webpage that it is reading
  a HTML document by declaring this code;<br>
  &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt<br>
  &lthtml&gt<br><br>
  Then you need to input the meta data and title of the webpage within the head element<br>
  &lthead&gtWebpage Title&lt/head&gt<br>
  <br><br>
  Finally, we can put in the contents of webpage within the body element
  &ltbody&gtWebpage Content&lt/body&gt<br><br>
  Some examples of elements you can find in the body include; Headings and paragraphs. 
  The &lth1&gt element is the first heading which is followed by the &lth2&gt element.
  Each consecutive heading is smaller than the first. Here is an example of the code (left) and the webpage (right);

<h1 style="text-align: center;">What is CSS?</h1>
<p class="dashed">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a language used to style a webpage. 
  Imagine a skeleton with its bones, but it looks plain and bare. 
  CSS is what you use to give that skeleton a cool and stylish appearance:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Colours:</strong> You can use CSS to change the color of the skeleton's 
    bones and the clothes it wears. For example, you can make the bones 
    white, the jacket black, and the shoes red.</li>
    <li><strong>Size and Shape:</strong> CSS lets you 
      adjust the size and shape of the skeleton's body 
      parts. You can make its head bigger, its arms longer, 
      or its legs thinner, just like tailoring clothes to 
      fit perfectly.</li>
      <li><strong>Position:</strong> You can position the skeleton's 
        body parts in different ways. You might want to raise its arm, 
        lower its leg, or tilt its head. CSS helps you control where each 
        part goes, just like arranging clothes on a mannequin.</li>
      <li><strong>Layout:</strong>CSS helps you arrange multiple skeletons 
        (webpage elements) on a page. You can place them side by side, 
        stack them, or create different layouts, just like arranging different 
        mannequins in a store window.</li>
</ol>
<p class="solid">CSS is like the fashion designer for a skeleton, making it look stylish 
  and presentable (as you can see, I'm not much of a fashion designer), just like clothes and accessories do for a person. 
  It gives your webpage its unique and attractive appearance.</p>
